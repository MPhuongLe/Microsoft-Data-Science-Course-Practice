# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Maps & Exploration | How can I predict suitable places-to-try from my old Google Map reviews? | - My past reviews (ratings, text, categories) <br> - Metadata of places (pricing range, cuisine type, location, opening hours, etc.) <br> - Reviews & Ratings from other users <br> - Context data (time visited, companions, purpose) | CSV files for prototyping; Relational database if scaling | - Recommend new place I'm likely yo enjoy <br> - Identify patterns (I like cheap places vs. fancy, quiet vs. crowded) <br> - Discover factors influencing my ratings|
| Hiring | What is needed for a DA/DS role (certificates, experience, technical & non-technical skills)? | - LinkedIn profiles of people in DA/DS roles <br> - Job descriptions from job boards <br> - Skills listed, years of experience, education <br> - Career transitions (previous roles) | CSV | - Identify most common required skills <br> - Compare skill gaps between me and market demand <br> - Decide which skills/certifications to prioritize learning |
| Productivity |  | Chrome browsing history (URLs, timestamps, duration) | | -Identify peak productive hours <br> - Detect main sources of distraction |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
